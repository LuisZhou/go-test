// URLs specify the location of a resource

// resource:
// HTML document, an image, or a sound file, dynamically generated object

// really?
// When a user agent requests a resource, what is returned is not the resource itself, but some representation of that
// resource. For example, if the resource is a static file, then what is sent to the user agent is a __copy__ of the file.
