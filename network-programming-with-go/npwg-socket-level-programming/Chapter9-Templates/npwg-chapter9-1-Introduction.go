package main

// Go has a template mechanism to convert strings based on the content of an object supplied as an argument. While this
// is often used in rewriting HTML to insert object values, it can be used in other situations.

// taking predominantly static pages and inserting a dynamically generated component

// Go has adopted a relatively simple scripting language in the  template package.

// The package is designed to take text as input and output different text, based on transforming the original text
// using the values of an object.

// The original source is called a template and will consist of text that is transmitted unchanged,
// and __embedded commands__ which can act on and change text.

// The commands are delimited by  {{ ... }}, like PHPs  <?php ... ?>
